# Email-Campain
This project evaluates Marketing Emails and their performance.
Using Power BI, I created dashboards to measure CTR, conversion rate, unsubscribe rate, and revenue generated.

Open Rate: +25%

CTR: +197%

Conversion Rate: +157%

Unsubscribe Rate: -413%
Revenue analysis showed Flash Sale & Newsletter campaigns (~$7M each) as the most effective.
